Revising git commands:
Initialising repository: git init the repository with same name on local
Adding the file to staging area: git add demo.html
commiting the file: git commit
copy the three codes of new repository created in the git-hub and execute in local vs code
PS D:\Project> git remote add origin https://github.com/Sairanga-Putta/Project.git
PS D:\Project> git branch -M main
PS D:\Project> git push -u origin main
if we change or add any new files in the repositories,first we have to pull the github repository into local and then commit and then push that into github.
Blame->split to see the changes.
